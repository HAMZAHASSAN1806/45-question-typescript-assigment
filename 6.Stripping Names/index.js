/* Question.06 Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the
beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least
once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name
after striping the white spaces. */
