/* Question.45 Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer
and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and 
two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information
was stored correctly. */
